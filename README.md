# EnerHabitat
## Tools for evaluating the thermal performance of structures based on EPW files

**enerhabitat** is a Python package for thermal simulation of constructive systems based on meteorological data from EPW files. The values that are calculated include:

- Ta  : Ambient temperature
- Tsa : Sun-Air temperature
- Ti  : Interior temperature
- Ig  : Global irradiance
- Ib  : Beam irradiance
- Id  : Diffuse irradiance
- Is  : Surface irradiance
